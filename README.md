# Fun-C-Calculator
My fun calculator made using C++!
Feel free to play around with it or to just check it out!
Tell me what you think about it in discusssions!
First the system will ask you what function you want to do (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Just type +, -, *, or /.
Then they will ask how many numbers you want to work with. Minimum is two and maximum is five.
After that, it will ask you the numbers you want to use. For example, if you selected three as the number of numbers you're going to use, you have to type three numbers. You can use decimals!
Finally, the system outputs the result. If you said '+', typed four for the number of numbers you want to use, and typed the numbers '6', '3', '124', and '23', the result will be '156'.
Hope you like it!
